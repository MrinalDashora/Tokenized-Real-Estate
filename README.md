# 🏠 Tokenized Real Estate

## 📌 Project Title
**Tokenized Real Estate**

## 📖 Project Description
Tokenized Real Estate is a decentralized Ethereum-based platform that allows real-world real estate assets to be fractionalized into digital tokens. Each token represents a share of a property and can be bought using Ether (ETH), making real estate investment more accessible, transparent, and efficient.

Unlike traditional systems, this project removes the need for high capital investments, legal intermediaries, and geographic restrictions, opening up property investment to anyone with an internet connection.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To democratize real estate ownership by creating a decentralized platform where properties can be tokenized and owned fractionally, enabling global participation in real estate markets.

The vision is to make buying a share in a building as easy as buying a cryptocurrency token.
